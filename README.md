## Services
### Hotel Service
The Hotel Service handles hotel-related functionalities. It is developed using Node.js and Express.js, providing CRUD operations for hotels and interacts with a MongoDB database.

### Auth Service
The Auth Service manages authentication using Firebase authentication and Firestore as its database. It provides user authentication and management functionalities.

### Booking Service
The Booking Service is responsible for managing bookings. Similar to the Hotel Service, it is developed using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, providing APIs for booking management.

### Frontend
The frontend is developed using Angular. It interacts with the services to provide a user-friendly interface for browsing hotels, making bookings, and managing user accounts.

   ```
   *(NB : Im using REACT)*

## Installation and Setup
### On localhost
1. Create a `.env` file following the format specified in the `/api-gateway/env.example`,`/frontend/env.example`, `booking/env.example` and `hotel/env.example` directories, following the format specified in each microservice directory.
2. Install dependencies for `root` directory, `hotel`, `booking`, and `api-gateway`:
```bash
npm install
```
And for frontend using:
```bash
yarn install
```
4. If you want start all services at once, run from root directory :

```bash
npm run start:all
```
5. If you want start each service separately, follow the instructions below:

*But first run this in `root` directory:*
```bash
run npm install
```
